# Documentation Archive

This directory contains old documentation files that are no longer actively maintained but kept for historical reference.

## Why These Files Are Archived

These documents were either:
- **Migration guides** for completed migrations (Ant Design, Email system, Database settings)
- **Implementation tracking** documents (now superseded by CHANGELOG.md)
- **Duplicate content** (multiple README files, setup guides)
- **Outdated guides** (replaced by consolidated documentation)
- **One-time notices** (setup complete messages)

## Current Active Documentation

- **[README.md](../README.md)** - Quick start and overview
- **[FEATURES.md](../FEATURES.md)** - Complete feature documentation
- **[SETUP.md](../SETUP.md)** - Installation and deployment guide

## When to Reference Archived Files

You might want to reference these files if:
- Understanding the **history** of a feature or migration
- Investigating **why** a particular decision was made
- Looking for **context** on how the system evolved
- Researching **old implementation details** that might still be relevant

## Maintenance

This archive should remain read-only. Do not update these files. All new documentation and changes should go in:
- Main documentation files for current information
- `CHANGELOG.md` for version history and changes
- `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md` for implementation guides
